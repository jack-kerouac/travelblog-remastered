# jack-kerouac's remastered travelblog.org travelblog

The content is scraped from traveblog.org backup HTML files. The photos have been matched to high-res original photos.
The scripts for both of that can be found in the repo travelblog-resampling.

## Structure

- `content/posts/` - Blog entries organized by trip ID
- `content/trips/` - Trip overview pages
- `static/images/` - Photos (low-res from backup, replaceable with high-res)
